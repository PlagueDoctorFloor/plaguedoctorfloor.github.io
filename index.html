                <h2>Welcome to my webpage!</h2>
                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p>My name is Florian Hurlbert. I'm a recent entrant into the world of adulthood, which is to say I graduated class of 2025 from Muhlenberg College,
                    haven't yet found a "professional" job (although I'm very much trying), and I yearn to return to the world of academia.
                </p>
                <p>I got my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science & English and Creative Writing. If you're like any of the many people I've told this to, now
                    making a weird face at your screen because that combination just doesn't quite make sense, allow me to explain. I know it's cliche but I've been
                    writing since as far back as I can remember. My fathers go-to bedtime stories were retellings of the Hobbit (slightly different each time),
                    or his own spin on Terry Pratchett's Granny Weatherwax. So I think it's fair to say I was hooked on fantasy before I ever knew the word. In elementary
                    school I was giving myself back pain taking 2-3 books to school when I couldn't decide which I wanted to read. I carried notebooks with me everywhere
                    for whenever inspiration struck. I excelled in English class, always doing all the reading and genuinely enjoying breaking down the books in essays.
                    Computer's were a latent love. I grew up with them, and have been a "gamer" since I got access to the internet. I started out with coolmathgames,
                    playing "Bartender: The Right Mix", "Fireboy and Watergirl", "Papa's Pizzeria", all the classics. My family had a Wii. Eventually I learned about
                    Steam and one of my very first PC games was Slime Rancher. I had an interest in learning to make games myself, but I struggled to learn coding.
                    So often I'd finish the coding lessons provided by Khan Academy or other "learn python by playing games" websites, and within a few days I'd feel
                    like I lost it all and didn't really learn anything.
                    Going into my first year of college I knew I wanted to attempt a double major, but I never could have guessed the result. Considering my history
                    with coding in the past, I went into my Computer Science I class saying "I'll do my best, maybe I'll drop down to a minor or switch to something 
                    else if it's just to hard." If you had told freshman year me that in a year I'd be recommended for a tutoring position? That in a couple years
                    I'd be running the general computer science workshop? That in 4 years I'd be walking across the stage with a 4.0 in Computer Science? I'd have
                    thought you were being really nice to me. Or you're a little nuts. Or both. But that's exactly what happened - coding turned out to be a language
                    I spoke very fluently. I fell in love with syntax, documentation, and data structures. Every lab felt like a puzzle I knew I could complete.
                    When it came to English and Creative Writing, I thought it would be a cake walk. After all, I've been writing all my life. My four years of Creative
                    writing broke me down to my core, and built me back up again, a new person. 
                </p>
                <h3>My Lab Parnters</h3>
                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <h4>Dungeons and Dragons</h4>
                <p>I was introduced to the famous tabletop roleplaying game in 2015, through at the time the brand new D&D club at my middle school.
                    I shall forever be thankful to the history teacher who taught middleschoolers D&D by DMing for all 20 of them at once!
                    My father, a first edition veteran, was very proud of my new interest and ran a game for my friends and I that lasted through most of highschool.
                    When I got to Muhlenberg College I learned about the Myths & Mules club, a student organization dedicated to teaching new players the game
                    and connecting Dungeon Masters to players. The minute I joined that Discord server, I signed away my next four years of evenings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today I play all different kinds of D&D. I'm in online games with my friends from college, and in person games with total strangers
                    I met at my local game store. I play everything from games starting at level 1 to level 10, games where we use completely homebrew classes, races, and backgrounds,
                    little to no combat games, very unserious silly games and games with such intense themes I get asked why I enjoy playing them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For those who like it, I think D&D can be a fantastic way to practice your creative skills and it can even push you to learn new
                    ones. It gives me a regular outlet to practice my writing, particularly my character crafting skills. I've had to learn to get much
                    better at improv and roleplay. I've even taken up digital art specifically because I needed to make references for my characters and
                    I wanted to be able to do it all on my own.
                </p>
                <h4>Movies</h4>
                <p>I may regrettably be a cinephile, (a person who really really likes movies) but I'm promise I'm the chill kind who just wants to talk your ear off,
                    not the annoying kind who only watches old movies or looks down on people for their movie choices. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It started with me constantly mentioning movies I wanted to see, and my roomate saying we should watch them together. One evening we were both
                    free and we finally watch Alien. We were still discussing the movie two hours later, and we agreed to watch Aliens the next night. After Aliens,
                    we knew we had to keep going, so we compiled a list of movies we wanted to see and we found the time to watch as many as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2025 we managed to watch 30 movies together, 24 of them being completely new to me and gaining new insights into the other 6. I've been adding
                    the posters to a <a href="https://tiermaker.com/create/-good--movie-tierlist-17313581">tiermaker</a>, and we periodically rank the movies. 
                    This is my most recent ranking:

                    A couple of movie recommendations I'd make from these:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Parasite, Directed by Bong Joon Ho - I don't know if a dubbed version of this movie exists, but if you can stand it I highly suggest watching
                    it in Korean with subtitles as the original performances are incredible. This film shows class disparity in South Korea through both the lens 
                    of comedy and horror. The set, constructed by the filmmakers, includes a gorgeous home at the literal top of society, surrounded by tall green
                    hedges, giving them only a view of beauty. In contrast, the main characters live below street level in crowded basement homes, several staircases
                    down from the rich home. The desperation of some of the characters is fascinating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hellraiser (1987) directed by Clive Barker - This is a horror film I feel like a lot of people have heard of, but in my circles very few people
                    had actually seen. I was inspired to watch it by <a href="https://youtu.be/TZka_p7XIxM?si=3lIocBy2-GKFQq_9">"The Box", a song by ICE NINE KILLS based on the movie.</a>
                    I had low expectations, and so was blown away by how great the special effects were. If you appreciate great practical effects (and have a strong stomach)
                    I highly recommend checking out this movie next halloween. I will say that the story has some strong flaws, particularly in it's commentary on
                    the BDSM community. That being said it's quite funny if you don't take it seriously! The last few scenes had us in absolute stitches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Synecdoche, New York directed by Charlie Kaufman - A peak cinephile movie! It's not for everyone, but if you're interested in contemplating questions
                    such as "What is art?" or "What is acting?", you will probably find some interesintg perspectives here. This film follows Caden Cotard, a theater
                    director who recieves the MacArther grant. He tries to create a giant theater piece with which he continaully tries to mirror real life. His life
                    away from the piece is also shown, in disparate scenes where things appear to degrade. It's a very open ended piece, and I highly suggest a group
                    viewing as you will probably want to talk about what you just saw.
