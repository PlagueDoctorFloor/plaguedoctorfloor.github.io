                <h2>Welcome to my webpage!</h2>
                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p>My name is Florian Hurlbert. I'm a recent entrant into the world of adulthood, which is to say I graduated class of 2025 from Muhlenberg College,
                    haven't yet found a "professional" job (although I'm very much trying), and I yearn to return to the world of academia.
                </p>
                <p>I got my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science & English and Creative Writing. If you're like any of the many people I've told this to, now
                    making a weird face at your screen because that combination just doesn't quite make sense, allow me to explain. I know it's cliche but I've been
                    writing since as far back as I can remember. My fathers go-to bedtime stories were retellings of the Hobbit (slightly different each time),
                    or his own spin on Terry Pratchett's Granny Weatherwax. So I think it's fair to say I was hooked on fantasy before I ever knew the word. In elementary
                    school I was giving myself back pain taking 2-3 books to school when I couldn't decide which I wanted to read. I carried notebooks with me everywhere
                    for whenever inspiration struck. I excelled in English class, always doing all the reading and genuinely enjoying breaking down the books in essays.
                    Computer's were a latent love. I grew up with them, and have been a "gamer" since I got access to the internet. I started out with coolmathgames,
                    playing "Bartender: The Right Mix", "Fireboy and Watergirl", "Papa's Pizzeria", all the classics. My family had a Wii. Eventually I learned about
                    Steam and one of my very first PC games was Slime Rancher. I had an interest in learning to make games myself, but I struggled to learn coding.
                    So often I'd finish the coding lessons provided by Khan Academy or other "learn python by playing games" websites, and within a few days I'd feel
                    like I lost it all and didn't really learn anything.
                    Going into my first year of college I knew I wanted to attempt a double major, but I never could have guessed the result. Considering my history
                    with coding in the past, I went into my Computer Science I class saying "I'll do my best, maybe I'll drop down to a minor or switch to something 
                    else if it's just to hard." If you had told freshman year me that in a year I'd be recommended for a tutoring position? That in a couple years
                    I'd be running the general computer science workshop? That in 4 years I'd be walking across the stage with a 4.0 in Computer Science? I'd have
                    thought you were being really nice to me. Or you're a little nuts. Or both. But that's exactly what happened - coding turned out to be a language
                    I spoke very fluently. I fell in love with syntax, documentation, and data structures. Every lab felt like a puzzle I knew I could complete.
                    When it came to English and Creative Writing, I thought it would be a cake walk. After all, I've been writing all my life. My four years of Creative
                    writing broke me down to my core, and built me back up again, a new person.

                <h3>My Lab Parnters</h3>
                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <h4>Dungeons and Dragons</h4>
                <p>I was introduced to the famous tabletop roleplaying game in 2015, through at the time the brand new D&D club at my middle school.
                    I shall forever be thankful to the history teacher who taught middleschoolers D&D by DMing for all 20 of them at once!
                    My father, a first edition veteran, was very proud of my new interest and ran a game for my friends and I that lasted through most of highschool.
                    When I got to Muhlenberg College I learned about the Myths & Mules club, a student organization dedicated to teaching new players the game
                    and connecting Dungeon Masters to players. The minute I joined that Discord server, I signed away my next four years of evenings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today I play all different kinds of D&D. I'm in online games with my friends from college, and in person games with total strangers
                    I met at my local game store. I play everything from games starting at level 1 to level 10, games where we use completely homebrew classes, races, and backgrounds,
                    little to no combat games, very unserious silly games and games with such intense themes I get asked why I enjoy playing them. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For those who like it, I think D&D can be a fantastic way to practice your creative skills and it can even push you to learn new
                    ones. It gives me a regular outlet to practice my writing, particularly my character crafting skills. I've had to learn to get much
                    better at improv and roleplay. I've even taken up digital art specifically because I needed to make references for my characters and
                    I wanted to be able to do it all on my own.
                </p>
                <h4>Movies</h4>
                <p>I may regrettably be a cinephile, but I'm promise I'm the chill kind who just wants to talk your ear off, not the annoying kind
                    who will get mad at you for not wanting to watch a random black and white french film.
